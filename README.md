## Our Problem
As an IT service provider with hundreds of customers, we currently have no monitoring in place for their services. Recently, due to issues with CrowdStrike and other factors, we have experienced several outages.

## Our Solution
Our customers need monitoring, and we plan to use Zabbix for this purpose. To avoid setting up Zabbix manually hundreds of times, we intend to automate the deployment using Terraform and Ansible. This will allow us to quickly establish monitoring for our customers and enable us to rebuild the monitoring servers rapidly if needed.
